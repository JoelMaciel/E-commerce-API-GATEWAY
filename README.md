## About the project.

### An API gateway is a middleware layer that acts as an intermediary between 
### clients and back-end APIs. It provides a single point of access to APIs,
### facilitating management and security.

## API gateways offer a number of benefits, including:

### Simplification of API management: API gateways allow you to centralize
### the management of all your APIs, which can help reduce complexity and costs.
## Improved security: 
### API gateways can help protect your APIs against attacks
### by providing features such as authentication, authorization and encryption.
## Improved performance: 
### API gateways can help improve the performance of your APIs by distributing 
### requests across multiple servers.
